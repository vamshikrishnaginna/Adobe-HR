rh._.exports({"0":["Scope of this document"],"1":["This document describes the TCPWave IPAMs architecture, components, GUI administration, security and tuning details.  It also describes the basic IPAM principles and gives guidance to operate the TCPWave IPAM. ","This book is intended for a technical audience. The audience may include network planners, IPAM administrators, and DNS and DHCP administrators. Readers of this book should have some background in DNS and DHCP as well as general network concepts. This guide helps while planning or during installation of the IPAM for a network.","DNS stands for Domain Name System. It provides resolution to a web URL. It converts web URL into an IP address. TCPWave IPAM contains 5 types of appliances.","They are: ISC BIND Authoritative, ISC BIND Cache, NSD Authoritative, UNBOUND Cache, DNS Proxy appliance.","To add a DNS Appliance in the IPAM, go to DNS Appliances page by clicking on the Network Management menu located at the top section of the IPAM Interface. ","To add a DNS Appliance, click the plus button located at the top left corner of the DNS view. While creating an object for DNS Appliance, user should select the object type as “TCPWave Remote”.  Enter IP Address (TCPWave Remote”) in the text field to auto fill host name and domain name.","When the user clicks on plus button, a details screen is displayed. In the details screen, type the following details in their respective fields.","Firewall Template: When the user associates the firewall template to the appliance, the configuration data is sent to the remote, update-firewall.sh script and iptables are restarted. When DNS/DHCP/IPAM appliance is updated with SNMP ACLs, by taking the configuration from associated firewall template, it updates the firewall rules configuration file with SNMP ACLs and sends to the remote.","When the firewall template association is changed for an appliance, the associated ACLs are taken from that appliance constructing the new firewall configuration file and sending it to the remote. When the firewall template gets self-updated, the list of appliances where the updated firewall template is associated constructing new configuration file is sent to the respective appliances.","User can select SNMP ACLs on the create/edit appliance page on the Monitoring tab.","Users can schedule the add/update/clone/delete and sync operations on a preferable date and time. During the creation of DNS appliance, once the user enters the relevant data in the fields and clicks OK, a pop-up appears – Please select OK to add now or Schedule to add later. On clicking Schedule, a Schedule Add Operation pop-up appears. ","Enter the Job ID, Execute On (GMT) and Time along with the description and click OK.","The scheduled job appears in the Scheduler Management section of the Administration tab. Users can schedule one-time job for add appliances operation.","Tab 1: Appliance Configuration","Input Field Label","Mandatory","Description","DNS Appliance Type","Yes","Select one of the DNS Appliance types from the dropdown. The dropdown list includes ","ISC BIND"," Authoritative Appliance","ISC BIND Cache Appliance","UNBOUND Cache Appliance","NSD Authoritative Appliance (These appliances can only be slaves due to the inability to accept the dynamic updates.)","DNS Proxy Appliance","Stealth Appliance","No","Select Yes when the DNS Appliance is a hidden master.","Internal Cache Appliance","No","This field is applicable for Cache appliances. By default, it is checked and it acts as an Internal Cache appliance which points to internal roots. If unchecked, it will take the external root hints from Internet Root Hints page to resolve the external domains.","Enable Automatic DNSDR","No","This field is applicable only for Internal BIND Cache appliances. When this field is checked, an internal BIND Cache appliance will be auto converted to standalone master when root appliances are not reachable for certain time interval (DNSDR configuration generation and send to remote server time interval, DNSDR Grace Time Interval). To enable recursion on standalone master, user can enable the global option (Enable Recursion on DNSDR Mode) from Global Policy Management page.","Service DMZ Visible Zones from Internal Network","No","This field is applicable only for External Cache appliances which are pointing to Internet Root Hints. By default, this option is enabled. When it is enabled, user can resolve the internal zones from external cache appliance which have DMZ visible options enabled in zone.","Enable Recursion","No","BIND Authoritative appliance can act as a Cache appliance to resolve Internal or External domains. While creating an appliance, user has the flexibility to select BIND AUTH appliance as a CACHE by enabling the Recursion check box. Once recursion check box is enabled, it will ask for the Internal Cache resolution or External resolution. By default, it is set to Internal Cache appliance.","‎When a BIND AUTH appliance is recursion enabled, it can resolve the non-managed zones from AUTH appliance. ","‎Constraints on AUTH+CACHE creation for Internal Cache Appliances: ","‎1. To create an AUTH+CACHE appliance, at least one root appliance needs to be defined.","‎2. Stealth appliance cannot act as an AUTH+CACHE appliance and vice versa.","‎","3. NSD is a slave only appliance in TCPWave IPAM, so it cannot act as AUTH+CACHE appliance.","‎","4. Root zone cannot be deleted if there is at least one AUTH+CACHE appliance defined.","Auto Restore Configurations","No","If there is any mismatch between the configuration files on IPAM and a particular remote, then the configuration files are updated automatically when this option is checked. These checks depend on the value defined in “Configuration Sync Time Interval” global option and the mismatched files on remote will be replaced by files on IPAM after the configuration checks. The list of files checked on the remote for mismatch are:","named: /opt/tcpwave/chroot/etc/named.conf","‎nsd: /opt/tcpwave/nsd/etc/nsd.conf","‎unbound: /opt/tcpwave/etc/unbound/unbound.conf","‎firewall: /opt/tcpwave/etc/firewall.conf","‎ntp: /opt/tcpwave/etc/ntp.conf","‎snmp: /opt/tcpwave/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf","‎syslog: /etc/rsyslog.conf","‎tacacs: /etc/pam.d/sshd","‎sshdconfig: /opt/tcpwave/etc/sshd_config","‎","zebraconfig: /opt/tcpwave/etc/zebra.conf","‎","bgpd: /opt/tcpwave/etc/bgpd.conf","‎","ospfd: /opt/tcpwave/etc/ospfd.conf","‎","resolver: /etc/resolv.conf","‎","banner: /etc/issue","Enable DNS over TLS","No","This option is available for BIND AUTH, BIND Cache, UNBOUND Cache and BIND AUTH+Cache appliances.
